# WordleFinal
Summer CSF Final Project
## How to Use
- Use any IDE that allows you to run Java
- Make sure all files are downloaded
- Have fun and add anything you'd like to improve!
## How it Works
- Uses Java Graphics
- A JPanel that reads when the buttons are clicked
- A JPanel that controls the functionality behind the buttons
- A File that stores data and calculates the average guesses you take
- Three different classes that control the changing of the text's color
